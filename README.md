# MuVViM
Utilities for Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) and the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern

## Motivation
Working with the Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) and the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern in particular often requires writing boilerplate or unnecessary verbose code both in the XAML views and the C# view models. This library is a very individual collection of different utilities or extensions that may be helpful when working with these technologies. Some parts were already used in small projects, others arised out of sudden inspiration. Therefore, this library should not serve a single purpose, but as a toolbox for future WPF projects.
